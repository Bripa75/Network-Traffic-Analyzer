# Network Traffic Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic to detect security anomalies. It uses the Scapy library to intercept and analyze packets on a network.

## Features
- **Packet Capture:** Captures live network packets for analysis.
- **Protocol Filtering:** Filters captured packets by protocol type (e.g., TCP, HTTP).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual patterns in network traffic, such as repeated requests from the same IP.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bripa75/Network-Traffic-Analyzer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
